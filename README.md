# Water-yield-change-in-the-Ebro-bassin
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in his sixth evaluation round, posits that it is certain that temperatures have increased during the twentieth century. This increase in temperature linked to climate change will have various consequences, such as extreme heat waves in many countries, the increase of intense precipitation and the risk of intense drought events. For this study, we use RCP scenarios 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 to conduct a spatial analysis of the evolution of water yield in the autonomous communities of La Rioja, Arag√≥n and Catalunya, as compared to the present.
